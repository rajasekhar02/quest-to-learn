## Quest To Learn
The primary goal of this project is to refactor my old portfolio site, utilizing modern technologies such as Vite, Tailwind CSS, and the latest version of React. By integrating data from my personal Notion database and implementing features like dark and light themes, I aim to provide an improved user experience and showcase my expertise as a developer.

## Technologies Used
### Previous Stack
- React 17
- Webpack
- Contentful CMS
- Bootstrap 5
- Responsive UI (supports Tablet/Large Screen)

### Current Stack

- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Light/Dark Theme
- Responsive UI (supports Mobile/Tablet/Large Screen)
- Integration with Notion
- Backend using Restify framework
